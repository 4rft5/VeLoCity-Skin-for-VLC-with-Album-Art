## Introduction

I believe that convenient UX and beautiful UI make our life better, it is no less important than a good view from the window or a good terrier. 
We look at the screen of our computers a lot of the time, it's a big part of our lives. I want people to get aesthetic pleasure from UX and UI.
And of course that HCG was easy intuitive logical and functional.

## VeLoCity skin for VLC.

Features:
- Built-in playlist.
- Mini window Layout spetial for audio (files and internet radio).
- Light appearance, but functionality.
- Small and functionality fullscreen Layout.
- Multiple color schemes (installed separately).
- Comfortable time slider. It is works well when you miss it slightly.
- Large spaces for dragging the window with a small overall interface size.


#### Unfortunately, there are limitations for VLC themes. And I'm not able to fix them. Some things I would like to add, but at the moment it is not possible:
- Skins does not work on Mac OS.
- You cannot drag window using the video zone.
- You can not start and stop the video by clicking on the video zone.
- You can not rewind the video by swiping through the video zone.
- You can't drag window over the titles and text zones.
- You cannot change the window size to the top or to the left.
- You cannot change the window size to the right without making an additional border.

## How to use these skins? 


 1. Put the downloaded VLT files in the following folder:

    - On Windows: the skins folder in the VLC installation directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\skins)
    - On Linux/Unix: ~/.local/share/vlc/skins2

 2. Then open VLC Settings>Interface>Look and Feel. And choose "Use Castom skin". 
    - You can choose skin already there in "Skin resource file"
    - Or change it in VLC. Rightclicking somewhere on the program window and going to Interface>Select Skin>.

 3. Enjoy It. And check my following works on  twitter.com/dmtiir/  or  github.com/dmtiir  or  dribbble.com/dmtiir
